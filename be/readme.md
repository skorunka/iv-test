# Number to Ordinal

Finish the function numberToOrdinal, which should take a number and return it as a string with the correct ordinal indicator suffix (in English).

That is:

- numberToOrdinal(1) ==> '1st'
- numberToOrdinal(2) ==> '2nd'
- numberToOrdinal(3) ==> '3rd'
- numberToOrdinal(4) ==> '4th'

See [Ordinal Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_numerals) section for more details.
